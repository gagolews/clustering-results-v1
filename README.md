# [A Framework for Benchmarking Clustering Algorithms](https://clustering-benchmarks.gagolewski.com)
## Results for Benchmark Suite Version 1

This repository is part of the
[**Framework for Benchmarking Clustering Algorithms**](https://clustering-benchmarks.gagolewski.com).

It hosts the outputs of various clustering algorithms for the datasets included
in the *Benchmark Suite for Clustering Algorithms: Version 1.1.0*;
see <https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1/>.

**Author/Editor/Maintainer**:
[Marek Gagolewski](https://www.gagolewski.com).


Refer to <https://clustering-benchmarks.gagolewski.com>
for the full description, file format specification,
example Python/R/MATLAB code, datasets explorer,
and literature references.

The datasets are provided solely for research purposes.
**Contributions of new results are warmly encouraged.**


> Note that in the case of the slower, more memory-gluttonous methods,
> only the results for smaller datasets and a few cardinalities
> are provided.

> Also, if a method fails to converge or returns a different number
> of clusters than requested, the respective output is not provided.

> The directory named `original` gives the results on the *original*
> data spaces, i.e., where only some minor feature preprocessing was applied;
> see the `README` file therein for more details.

> `scale_standard` contains some (incomplete) results for datasets
> with standardised variables.
